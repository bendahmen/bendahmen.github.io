"Student Employment in England after the Maintenance Grant Removal","papers/maintenance_grant.pdf",,"In 2016 the UK removed a living cost grant for university students. Motivated by a large increase in student employment after the grant was removed, I estimate whether the loss in income pushed students to work during university. I use two Difference-in-Differences designs, the first compares students to the regular labor market, and the second splits students by grant eligibility. Although student employment increased compared to the regular labor market, the increase is common to eligible and ineligible students. My results suggest that the maintenance grant removal did not cause the increase in student employment.","img/employment_ts.png","Student employment over time"
"Inequality in Internships",,"papers/internships.pdf","Internships may play an important role in shaping labour market inequality. Using Dutch admin data, we show that the richest university students are 39% more likely to do an internship than the poorest students. We explore what creates this difference and what consequences it has on students' careers. Ability does not explain the difference, but the opportunity costs of doing an internship could be important. After graduation, internships are linked to significantly higher earnings and contribute to intergenerational immobility. In the future, we plan to find a causal strategy to estimate internship returns, and analyse how personal networks help students find internships.","img/internships.png","Rich Students do more Internships"
