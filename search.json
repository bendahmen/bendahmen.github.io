    "text": "Student Employment in England after the Maintenance Grant Removal\n\n\nIn 2016 the UK removed a living cost grant for university students. Motivated by a large increase in student employment after the grant was removed, I estimate whether the loss in income pushed students to work during university. I use two Difference-in-Differences designs, the first compares students to the regular labor market, and the second splits students by grant eligibility. Although student employment increased compared to the regular labor market, the increase is common to eligible and ineligible students. My results suggest that the maintenance grant removal did not cause the increase in student employment."
